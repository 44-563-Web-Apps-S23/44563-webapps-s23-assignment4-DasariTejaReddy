<h6>THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK _Sir James M. Barrie_</h6>
<p>
    <h4>SIR HARRY.</h4>[_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?<br>
    <h4>LADY SIMS.</h4> [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.<br>
    <h4>SIR HARRY.</h4> But was it dignified?<br>
    <h4>LADY SIMS.</h4> Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
sword.<br>
<h4>SIR HARRY.</h4>The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?<br>
<h4>LADY SIMS.</h4>No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
do almost too well?<br>
<h4>SIR HARRY.</h4>I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
asked for. <br>
